"feat: initial project setup

This commit initializes the Pac-Man game project.

- Created a main.c file for the game logic.
- Included necessary header files (stdio.h, stdlib.h, etc.).
- Defined basic game constants (mapa.txt, with character positions).
- Implemented a simple game loop for testing.

The game currently only displays a basic board with no functionality yet."
